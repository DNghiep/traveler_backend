# Traveler backend
Each person in the group should branch from the `master` branch and work on that branch.

Before working on the project, make sure use these commands:
```
npm install     # install dependencies
npm start       # start the server
```
to install dependencies and to start the server (the server is run at port `1337`)

Each backend implementation should be put on respective folder in `routes`    
The route will have the address of `/api/[api_name]` for the request. For example: `localhost:1337/api/search`
